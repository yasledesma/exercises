# HOW TO DRIVE A CAR
## Finger exercise:
Try writing an algorithm for driving a car between two destinations. Write it the way you would for a person, and then imagine what would happen if the person executed the algorithm exactly as written. For example, how many traffic tickets might they get?

### Basic driving algorithm: GO FROM POINT A TO POINT B

GO FROM POINT A TO POINT B:
Enter your car.
Sit down in the driver seat.
    Is this an atomatic car?
        Get out of the car.  **I don't know how to drive an automatic car.**
    Is this a manual car?
        START MANUAL CAR
    Ultil you get from point A to point B
        Keep the steering wheel straight as the car starts moving forward.
        If there is a large object, or a person, or an animal, in front of your car
            STOP CAR
        If there is a street junction
            Turn to the right or turn to the left.


START MANUAL CAR:
    Grip the steering wheel with both hands.
    Put your left foot on the clutch, and your right foot on the accelerator.
    Take your right hand off the steering wheel and place it on the driving stick.
    Set the driving stick on one.
    Put you right hand back on the steering wheel.
    Press the clutch all the way down.
    Slowly press down on the accelerator pedal, while releasing the clutch at equal pace.   

STOP CAR:
    Press the clutch all the way down.
    Slowly press down on the break, while releasing the clutch at equal pace, until the car stops completely.

### Answer:
If a person followed these instructions correctly, they'll probably end up getting a lot of traffict tickets due to:
- Never stopping at traffict lights. 
- Stopping preemptively in situations that don't really call for it.
- Not regulating their car velocity properly (in the sense that they would always be driving too fast.)
